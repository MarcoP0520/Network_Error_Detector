# Network Error Detector

### Project Overview
    Project Manager: Alan Gonzalez
    Network System Engineer: Marco Perez
    Stakeholders: Data Centers, IT Teams, and Cloud Providers

### Project Statement
    Building reliable network infrastructures is challenging and errors can occur throughout the process. Without an 
    effective monitoring system, Stakeholders may struggle to detect issues promptly, leading to downtime and 
    inefficiencies. This project aims to develop a network error detector that quickly identifies problems, enabling 
    rapid and efficient responses to maintain network reliability.

### Project Objectives
    Primary Goal:
        To develop a reliable network error detection system that identifies problems quickly, ensuring rapid responses 
        and maintaining network reliability.
    
    Key Objectives:
        1. Provide Stakeholders with real-time updates
        2. Implement a notification system to alert Stakeholders of detected issues on connection status via discord
        3. Ensure ease of use and accessibility for Stakeholders

### Success Criteria
    Project will be successful if:
        1. Discord Bot correctly distributes network status updates
        2. The system consistently detects and reports network errors in real-time
        3. Stakeholders can easily access and interpret network status

### Key Questions to Answer
    1. How will the Discord bot format and send notifications?
    2. How frequently should the system check for network issues?
    3. What specific network errors will the system detect?

### Constraints and Assumptions
    Constraints:
        1. Limited Development time
        2. Platform Restriction
        3. Real-time Update Frequency
    
    Assumptions:
        1. Stakeholders have access to smartphones or computer
        2. Discord bot functions as expected
        3. Users understand basic network terminology
